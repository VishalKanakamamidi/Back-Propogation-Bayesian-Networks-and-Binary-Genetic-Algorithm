# Back-Propogation-Bayesian-Networks-and-Binary-Genetic-Algorithm

Backpropogation:<br/>

	I have implemented Back Propogation on IRIS Dataset in this jupyter-notebook. The version of Python used here is Python 3.6<br/>
	I have removed the first row of iris dataset as it was of no use as it was used to define the attributes. <br/>
  I have used K-fold Cross validation technique for testing.<br/>
  I have used comments wherever necessary to explain the functions.<br/><br/>
